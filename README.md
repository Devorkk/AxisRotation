# About
KoGaMa Axis Rotation is a tool that allows you to rotate objects from different angles. Made only for web and used [`guify`](https://github.com/colejd/guify) to make the interface.<br>
> For now it will be called Axis Rotation as in the future I will be updating it and adding other tools to improve the build.
